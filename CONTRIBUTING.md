This is the guide for contributing to the repo.

## Folder structure

Every different competition source code goes into separate folder with the name of the competition. If the name is long a understandable 
short form can be used

Utilities are placed in a separate `util` folder.

Algorithms are placed in `algos` folder

## README

A separate README.md file goes into each folder for information on the project. 

## Branches

Each code contribution goes into a separate branch pulling into the master.  `master` branch will be a protected branch not allowing 
commits directly onto it. Moreover, a code review is needed before the code can be merged from atleast one person with a write access to 
the repo.
